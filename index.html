            <h3>~Wayne Gretzky</h3> 
            <p>As an administrative assistant with experience in the medical  and non-profit sectors, employers depend on my skills, intuitive nature, sound judgement, and professionalism to complete tasks with little notice and a looming deadline. I approach the task at hand with an arsenal of skills that includes: advanced Word and Excel ability; moderate PowerPoint and Access knowledge; meticulous writing, editing, and proof-reading; strong organization; exceptional attention to detail; and an exemplary ability to meet deadlines. A top-notch administrative assistant is the proverbial Jack-of-all Trades and works tirelessly to stay one step ahead of the learning curve. As such, I recently dove head-first into learning HTML, CSS, and  basic JavaScript. Beyond knowledge and tangible skills, however, I truly value a work environment that fosters collaboration among colleagues and one that encourages me to intellectually stretch myself.</p>
